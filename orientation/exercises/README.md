# Node.js Orientation Exercises

This is a suggested order for completing the exercises in orientation.

The `challenges` folder contains some optional extra brain-burning you can tackle at any time, when you feel ready. Do them solo, or grab a teammate or two and dive in. The calendar exercise is an especially good one to try with a group.
