# Initial Course Installs

## SQL Browser

The [DB browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/) will let you view, query and manage your databases during the course.

## Node

## Troubleshooting


## Hello, world

We're going to do the traditional `Hello, world` program to start off. Put the following code in `~/workspace/node/hello.js`.

```js
console.log("Hello!")
console.log("Is it me you're looking for?")
```

In the CLI, execute the following command in the `python` directory.

```bash
node hello.js
```

## Node Interpreter

You can use the CLI interpreter to enter and run some code that you just want to test out without having to put it in a file and running it.

```
$ node
> let i_am_awesome = true
> if (i_am_awesome) console.log("bow down to me")

bow down to me
```
